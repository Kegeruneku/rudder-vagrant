=== Synopsis

This git repository contains a Vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com) configuration, enabling
the user to launch from scratch a complete Rudder environment in a few minutes.

=== Requirements

There are two dependencies: VirtualBox and Vagrant.

The former may be installed using your favorite package management system, and the latter
using RubyGems.

See the complete installation instructions here:

* VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* Vagrant: http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/getting-started/index.html

=== Usage

When you have the required dependencies, you will have to ensure that your local machine
also resolves as "server.rudder.local". This can be done by copy-pasting this small shell
script chunk in you favorite shell. You only need to do this once.

-------------------
if ! grep -q "server.rudder.local" /etc/hosts; then sudo sed -i "s/^\(127\.0\.0\.1.*\)/\1 server.rudder.local/" /etc/hosts; fi
-------------------

Clone this repository:

----
git clone https://github.com/Normation/rudder-vagrant.git && cd rudder-vagrant
----

Then you can use the Vagrant environment at will:

* To launch the complete environment: server and node

----
vagrant up # To launch the complete environment: server and node
----

NOTE: Your rudder environment is available at: http://server.rudder.local:8080/

NOTE: The node and the server are automatically set to communicate with each
other, but you will have to wait approximately 10mn before the node appears in
Rudder's web interface in the node acceptation pane.
If you are in a hurry, run a /opt/rudder/sbin/cf-agent on the node, and on the
server to make things go a bit faster.


=== Command reference for Vagrant

* Launch selectively one machine:

----
vagrant up server
----

* Cleanly shutdown the VMs (issuing a "vagrant up" after that does not deploy the
VMs again but instead starts them normally)

----
vagrant halt
----

* Trash the enviroment (obliterate the VMs)

----
vagrant destroy
----

* Suspend / Resume the VMs (NOT RECOMMENDED)

----
vagrant suspend # Or "resume"
----

NOTE: This command messes up the VMs clock (I call that the DeLorean effect) and is
likely to make Rudder output odd reports if you do not have an active NTP daemon.

* Open an SSH shell connection to a machine

----
vagrant ssh server
----
